# Kmeans-clustering-visulization
I've written this simple program for having a very simple visualization of the algorithm Kmeans Clustering :3 
# How to run
- When you run the program, a window will appear. Using your left click of your mouse to mark a point on the screen.
- Then let's choose the number of cluster that you want by clicking the "+" or "-" button, the algorithm will classify all data (here are the points or 2D vectors) into these clusters. The number of clusters are represented by the letter "K".
- Click the "Random" button, the program will create randomly K points in different colors, which are the central point of each cluster.
- Then click the "Run" button several times until the "Error" is unchanged => the classification task completed, points have colors corresponding to the cluster that it belongs to.
- The "Algorithm" button can be used for complete the classification immediately beacause it use the function in the Scikit-learn library.
